        <h3>The startup</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            We chose <a target="_blank" href="https://unitworkers.com/">Unit</a> as a startup to design for.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Unit is a digital labor advisor for unionizing, consisting of an organizing app, educational materials, and
            professional staff guidance. These elements come together to help workers organize their coworkers, get
            their
            union recognized, enshrine the changes they want into a contract, and manage their union and contract
            between
            subsequent negotiations.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            In particular, Unit provides:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>educational resources to guide workers through their campaigns</li>
            <li>automated filing of legal paperwork and election petitions</li>
            <li>software tools to help workers map their workplace and assess how supportive their coworkers are</li>
            <li>professional organizers to help workers strategize to maximize their chances of their bosses legally
                accepting
                their union, called voluntary recognition, or having their union be legally accepted by the federal
                government, by winning an NLRB election.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <p>
            We focused in particular on the third bullet point: a software platform for mapping the workplace. <strong>We
            decided to prototype a desktop website, since data visualizations are easiest to view on a large
            screen.</strong> Furthermore, although we imagine having two views into the app: admin and user, we decided
            to focus on the admin view, which provides features for managing the overall union campaign. The user-facing
            view would be very similar, but with fewer features and capabilities.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h4>Users</h4>
        <br/>
        <p>We aimed to design our prototype with the following users in mind:</p>
        <br/>
        <details>
            <summary>Workers</summary>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Specifically in small, independent companies, since larger ones might have more attention from
                    existing unions
                </li>
                <li>
                    People with little tech/data background; the platform can provide these users with intuitive and
                    abstracted ways of analyzing their workplaces
                </li>
                <li>
                    Isolated workforces that have few clear opportunities for mingling in the workplace and need clear
                    structures for understanding relationships between workers
                </li>
            </ul>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Union organizers</summary>
            <ul>

            </ul>
        </details>

        <h3>High-fidelity mockup</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Our mockup consists of a main dashboard screen from which users can navigate
            to more specific screens. At the top of this page are progress bars and metrics,
            which let users clearly see movement progress as well as their own individual progress.
            Underneath these are upcoming events and updates. Using the navigation bar at the top of
            the screen, users can navigate to pages like "worker lists" in which they can keep
            track of their co-workers and their status in relation to the movement.

        <h3>High-fidelity mockup crit</h3>
        <hr>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Users noted that the circle charts were confusing, saying that the color scheme,
                lack of clear directionality, and lack of numbers made it difficult to understand. To resolve this,
                we added a key to the circle chart as well as an arrow, allowing users to more intuitively
                understand what the progress bar is conveying.
            </li>

            <li>
                Users noted that the "save and exit" button for editing goals had a plus sign, 
                which implied addition. To resolve this, we changed the plus sign to a check mark.
            </li>

            <li>
                Users noted that the calendar seemed more useful than general updates, and suggested increasing
                its prominence. To resolve this, we expanded the "upcoming" section with dates and thumbnail images,
                so users can more clearly see the upcoming timeline of their movement.
            </li>
