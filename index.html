        <h3>The startup</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            We chose <a target="_blank" href="https://unitworkers.com/">Unit</a> as a startup to design for.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Unit is a digital labor advisor for unionizing, consisting of an organizing app, educational materials, and
            professional staff guidance. These elements come together to help workers organize their coworkers, get
            their
            union recognized, enshrine the changes they want into a contract, and manage their union and contract
            between
            subsequent negotiations.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            In particular, Unit provides:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>educational resources to guide workers through their campaigns</li>
            <li>automated filing of legal paperwork and election petitions</li>
            <li>software tools to help workers map their workplace and assess how supportive their coworkers are</li>
            <li>professional organizers to help workers strategize to maximize their chances of their bosses legally
                accepting
                their union, called voluntary recognition, or having their union be legally accepted by the federal
                government, by winning an NLRB election.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <p>
            We focused in particular on the third bullet point: a software platform for mapping the workplace. <strong>We
            decided to prototype a desktop website, since data visualizations are easiest to view on a large
            screen.</strong> Furthermore, although we imagine having two views into the app: admin and user, we decided
            to focus on the admin view, which provides features for managing the overall union campaign. The user-facing
            view would be very similar, but with fewer features and capabilities.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h4>Users</h4>
        <br/>
        <p>We aimed to design our prototype with the following users in mind:</p>
        <br/>
        <details>
            <summary>Workers</summary>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Specifically in small, independent companies, since larger ones might have more attention from
                    existing unions
                </li>
                <li>
                    People with little tech/data background; the platform can provide these users with intuitive and
                    abstracted ways of analyzing their workplaces
                </li>
                <li>
                    Isolated workforces that have few clear opportunities for mingling in the workplace and need clear
                    structures for understanding relationships between workers
                </li>
            </ul>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Union organizers</summary>
            <ul>

            </ul>
        </details>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Sketches</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Each row represents the variety of designs considered for a screen. For the first screen, we wanted
            to explore different ways of keeping track of all the workers that the union organizers will be having
            conversations with. The designs we toyed with involved a table view and a graph view. The position of
            the filtering tools varied with a toolbar + buttons and a stickied side view with the filtering options.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>For the second screen, we toyed with different ways to represent a timeline page where union organizers
            could set goals for a duration of time, view, and interact with the goals in an intuitive and useful way.
            The different views we considered was a linear view, table view, calendar view, and graph view.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The third screen concerned the main dashboard or home page. We wanted this is to be a hub of information
            that houses links to the other screens. We considered a block/folder view, a summary/statistics view, a
            table view, and a calendar view.

        </p>

        <h3>Wireframes</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>For our wireframes, we decided to focus our functionality somewhat. For instance, we focused on a table
            layout for worker lists, abandoning the graph view for simplicity's sake. It could be a nice feature to add
            later on.</p>

        <h3>High-fidelity mockup</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Our mockup consists of a main dashboard screen from which users can navigate
            to more specific screens. At the top of this page are progress bars and metrics,
            which let users clearly see movement progress as well as their own individual progress.
            Underneath these are upcoming events and updates. Using the navigation bar at the top of
            the screen, users can navigate to pages like "worker lists" in which they can keep
            track of their co-workers and their status in relation to the movement.
        </p>

        <h3>High-fidelity mockup crit</h3>
        <hr>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Users noted that the circle charts were confusing, saying that the color scheme,
                lack of clear directionality, and lack of numbers made it difficult to understand. To resolve this,
                we added a key to the circle chart as well as an arrow, allowing users to more intuitively
                understand what the progress bar is conveying.
            </li>

            <li>
                Users noted that the "save and exit" button for editing goals had a plus sign,
                which implied addition. To resolve this, we changed the plus sign to a check mark.
            </li>

            <li>
                Users noted that the calendar seemed more useful than general updates, and suggested increasing
                its prominence. To resolve this, we expanded the "upcoming" section with dates and thumbnail images,
                so users can more clearly see the upcoming timeline of their movement.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>User testing</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>We uploaded our prototype to <a href="https://usertesting.com">User Testing</a> to get some feedback from
            real users on our design. We unfortunately couldn't target people interested in unionizing their workforce,
            but it was interesting to see how everyday people would interpret union lingo.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h4>The task</h4>
        <br/>
        <p>We tested our prototype on three users, all of whom were given the task of <strong>adding a worker to their
            master worker list.</strong> Click on the links below to view videos of their attempts and feedback.</p>

        <p>The users were asked the following sub-questions. We summarize the responses of each user.</p>
        <br/>

        <h4>Analysis of results</h4>
        <br/>
        <p>We clearly had an issue with users understanding the purpose of the site. Because we never explicitly
            mentioned the word "union," it was unclear exactly what "organizing a workforce" meant. To those with
            familiarity with union campaigns, this might seem obvious, and it was useful to realize that this isn't for
            most people! <strong>To fix this, we could add an intro page that introduces important terms and concepts
                for those new to union organizing. Also having a setup page that asks you about your workplace would be
                useful.</strong></p>
        <br/>
        <p>On a positive note, users found our interface very easy to navigate. Buttons and links were well-placed and
            no one had any trouble at all in completing the task. <strong>To make this even better, we could change
                language on the site slightly to make it less jargon-ey.</strong></p>
